# Homework-3
Code Quiz - Web APIs </br>
Github Page: https://brittanymorrisdesign.github.io/Homework-4

# Objective
To build a code quiz with multiple-choice questions; stores high scores client-side.

Play proceeds as follows:
• The user arrives at the landing page and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" and the "Time" value set at 0.

• Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.

• Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).

• When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`. </br>
